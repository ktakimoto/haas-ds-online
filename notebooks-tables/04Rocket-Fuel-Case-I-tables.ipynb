    "With the second question in mind, they agreed to run an **A/B test**. The majority of the people exposed to Rocket Fuel's content delivery network would see TaskBella's handbag ad (the **experimental group**). But, a small portion of people (the **control group**) would instead see a Public Service Announcement (PSA) in the exact size and place the ad would normally be. One PSA example is below:\n",
