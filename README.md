# Berkeley Program on Data Science and Analytics

Materials for Module IV of the Berkeley Program on Data Science and Analytics.

The Berkeley Program on Data Science and Analytics is  a collaboration of Eruditus Executive Education and the University of California Berkeley Executive Education at the Haas School of Business. Our six-month program is a journey into the world of applied data science and analytics, essential for any executive who wishes to lead and manage a data-driven organization. The program will prepare you with the tools to build and lead data science teams through data-driven decision-making. You will learn how to promote a data-driven culture, how to translate business problems into data problems, and how to lead a team with a diverse skill set towards solving these problems.
